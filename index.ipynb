    "Perhaps the most common solution to dealing with missing values is to simply drop any rows that contain them.  Of course, this is only a good idea if the number dropped does not constitute a significant portion of our dataset.  Often, you'll need to make the overall determination to see if dropping the values is an acceptable loss, or if it is a better idea to just drop an offending column (e.g. the `'Cabin'` column) or to impute placeholder values instead.\n",
